    "\"Then I'll ask."
    
    "Arcueid, your 'enemy', what kind of vampire is he?"

    "I only knew just recently that the vampire in this city was here."
    
    "I came here as soon as I knew the 'enemy' was in this city in this country, but I have never met him."
    
    "So to be honest, I don't know anything about the 'enemy' this time.\""
    
    "\"You don't know?----Didn't you recognize Nrvnqsr on sight?\""
    
    "\"Nrvnqsr was famous, and he never changed his appearance."
    
    "While the \"enemy\" I'm pursuing isn't as strong of a vampire, his traits fall within a broad range and I have no idea of his specialties or features this time."
    
    "I'm really sorry Shiki---but I really can only tell you this much.\""
    
    ".... I know she's not lying."
    
    "I know, but still, I feel like she's hiding something."
    
    "Like----"
    
    "\"That's okay."
    
    "You can't help it if you don't know."

    "She cannot tell me his name for some reason, and she is troubled."

    "A period of silence ensues between us."
