    "I don't know what's behind it all, but she was breathing so painfully."
    
    "Rather than trying to hunt The Dead, she might have just gone back to her room."

    ".... I press the doorbell."
    
    "It doesn't seem like anyone's coming out."
    
    "\"----Shit, she hasn't come back?\""
    
    "No matter how many times I push the button, her door doesn't open."
    
    "\"......\""
    
    "Did she not come back, or is she just not coming out?"
    
    "----After hesitating, I decide to go inside."
    
    "It'd be a simple thing to cut the \"lines\" on the door."
    
    "But, I should just check the knob first."
    
    "\".... Huh?\""
    
    "It's not locked."
    
    "The door opens simply with a turn."

    ".... No response."
    
    "Did she not lock it in the first place?"
    
    "There's no one around."
    
    "\"Where does she think she's going in that condition....!?\""
    
    "I slam my fist against the wall."
    
    "\".... Grr.\""
    
    ".... what am I doing?"
    
    "If I have time to let it out on the wall, I have to go out and look for her----"

    ".... I can't find her."
    
    "Come to think of it, if she really intends not to be found, there's no chance of me finding her at all."
    
    "\".... She said we'd meet again tomorrow.\""
    
    "All I can do in this situation is to trust her and wait for tomorrow night."
    
    "\"............\""
    
    "With a great uneasiness in my chest, I return to the mansion."
