    "It's quiet at the mansion gate."
    
    "The time is seven o'clock at night."
    
    "Akiha should be back, probably having tea in the sitting room."
    
    "............ *sigh*"
    
    "I don't really feel like leisurely eating dinner at all, but if I don't go back, Akiha and the others will probably worry about me again."
    
    "Looking for Arcueid will have to wait until after dinner."
    
    "I'll leave when Akiha and everyone else go to sleep."

    "I had some tea after dinner with Kohaku-san and the others, but I don't even remember what went on."
    
    "\"----Where the heck is she?\""
    
    "My head is only filled with thoughts of that golden-haired vampire."

    "At ten o'clock, the lights in the mansion are turned off."
    
    "At bedtime, everyone goes back to their rooms, so I slip out of the mansion undetected."
    
    "\".... She's, probably in the city?\""
    
    ".... I don't want to think about it, but most of the victims are usually found in alleys."
    
    "If I want to find Arcueid----if I want to find the vampire killer who's continuing to murder, then I have to search the streets."

    "I sit down on the guard rail."
    
    "It's been several hours already."
    
    "I looked around aimlessly, and I didn't even catch a single glimpse of Arcueid."
    
    "\"........ Damn it.\""
    
    "It's so, frustrating."
    
    "Of course, I knew it isn't easy to just randomly find someone in town, but I still felt optimistic I would find her."
    
    "\"Where did she go....?\""
    
    ".... Why?"
    
    "I just wanted to ask her about the serial killings, but once I find out I can't see her, I----"
    
    "\"Ah, stop."
    
    "Stop."
    
    "I should just stop.\""
    
    "I stand up from the guardrail and start walking."
    
    "It'll be midnight soon."
    
    "Searching for Arcueid any longer really is just useless."
    
    "\"........\""
    
    "But, if I've gone this far, I can do just a little more."
    
    "There's one last place I need to check."
    
    "If she's not there, then I'll go back to the mansion."

    "I arrive at the place where I cooperated with Arcueid and defeated Nrvnqsr."
    
    "Having only looked in town, I've yet to search here."
    
    "\".... Well, not that I'll find anything....\""

    "Midnight."
    
    "As expected, there's no one here this late at night."
    
    "With this much silence, it rather feels refreshing."
    
    "\".... That's right."
    
    "It's not like I can conveniently find her.\""
    
    "I let out a sigh and slump my shoulders."
    
    "\".... How stupid."
    
    "Why am I so disappointed?\""
    
    "I don't understand it myself."
    
    "Just, once more----I think maybe I wanted to see her smile."

    "To be honest, I wanted to see you too."
    
    "So meeting here, um----\""
    
    "I was about to say it makes me really happy, but I frantically choke those words off."
    
    "\"----Anyway, I want to have a serious talk."
    
    "I want to talk about it somewhere else since I feel uneasy here, so is that okay?\""
    
    "\"Sure----but talk about what?\""
    
    "\"You'll see."
