    "No matter how hard I try, I can't hide it from Hisui and Kohaku-san who are in charge of maintaining the mansion."
    
    "So, the least I can do is let them know when I'll be gone every night in the following days."
    
    "\".... Yeah, to tell the truth, I'll probably leave for a number of nights starting now."
    
    "I swear I'm not just playing around or doing anything bad."
    
    "Akiha will probably end up hating me, but I can't stop now.\""
    
    "Yeah."
    
    "The vampire is still somewhere in town preying on victims."
    
    "As a person who lives here, I just can't pretend like I didn't see it."
    
    "\"---I know it's a burden to you, Hisui, but please overlook it."
    
    "I don't know what time I'll be back, so please just leave the gate unlocked.\""
    
    "\"Shiki-sama, are you saying you will not tell us why?\""
    
    "\".... Yeah, sorry Hisui."
    
    "You can think I'm totally irresponsible, but please don't ask."
    
    "I, don't want to have to lie.\""
    
    "\".... No."
    
    "You are my master."
    
    "A servant does not despise her master like that.\""
    
    "She speaks plainly and without any expression."
    
    "The conversation ends and I go up to return to my room."

    "\"---Yes."

    "There's a servant's entrance?"
    
    "No wonder I never saw you leave through the gate.\""
