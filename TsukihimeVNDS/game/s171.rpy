    "I've met you here a lot, but it seems like a totally different place.\""
    
    "Arcueid seems to be in a good mood."
    
    "I just planned to walk around the park, but she doesn't seem discontent at all."
    
    "\"Oh, there's a store in a place like this."
    
    "Shiki, what does that sell?\""
    
    "Arcueid points excitedly at a vendor's stand."
    
    "The path from the fountain leads to a wheeled ice cream stand."
    
    "\"That's an ice cream seller out of season."
    
    "Cold things aren't good for the body, so we should just pass it up for now.\" I stop Arcueid's question before she asks."

    "No matter how unhappy a face she makes, I don't think eating ice cream in the fall would be good at all."
    
    "----But, what is this strange feeling?"
    
    "I feel weird just walking, I feel everyone's watching us...."

    "\"Hey Shiki, do you know all these people?\""
    
    "\"No, there's only one person I know who'd skip school to hang around like that."
    
    "Why?\""
    
    "\"Hm, a lot of people seem to be looking at us, so I thought maybe you knew them.\""
    
    "\".... I see."
    
    "So that's what felt strange.\""
    
    "I get it now."
    
    "I was just walking around to find a good spot on the grass to sit down on, but everyone is stealing glances at us."
    
    "It doesn't need to be said, but they're looking at Arcueid, not me."
    
    "I've been doing my best not to be conscious of it, but Arcueid is just unbelievably beautiful."
    
    "And walking in the park is just asking for stares."
    
    "The guys killing time in the park all start to look at her."
    
    ".... For some reason, I feel angry."
    
    "\"Arcueid, let's go somewhere else.\""
    
    "Grabbing her hand, I pull her as I walk towards the back of the park."
    
    scene expression 'background/BG_29A.jpg' at bgpos
    
    "The place we usually meet has much less people than right in front of the fountain."
    
    ".... This should be little better than before, at least."
    
    "\"We'll kill time here a little bit."
    
    "I'm going to get something to drink, you have any requests?\""
    
    "I let go of her hand and turn towards her."

    "\"Sure."
    
    "Go ahead and sit on that bench.... if some guy starts to talk to you, just don't listen to him.\""

    ".... I'm not sure why, but Arcueid's been quiet since we came here."
    
    "She hasn't even drank the water I got for her, and she just looks around the park doing nothing."
    
    "We watch the flocks of pigeons around the park and the happily running figures of children accompanied by their mothers."

    "\"Hm?"
    
    "Are you bored just spacing out?"
    
    "We can go somewhere and get something to eat if you want.\""
    
    "\"No, that isn't it.... I was just wondering about what happened before.\""
    
    "\"....?\""
    
    "Before?"
    
    ".... What is she talking about?"
    
    "\"I don't get it."
    
    "What do you mean?\""
    
    "\"I'm talking about when you grabbed my hand earlier."
    
    "We've come into contact before, but there was always a reason."
    
    "But just now, there wasn't a reason, so I was wondering just what it was.\""
    
    "\"What it was?----There really wasn't a reason or anything.\""
    
    "Saying that, I also get confused."
    
    ".... Come to think of it, I pulled her along naturally for no reason."
    
    "That being said, I don't even understand why."
    
    "\"It doesn't really matter."
    
    "It's not that big of a deal."
    
    "Something sudden like that, is just human.\""

    "\"Hey Shiki."
    
    "It's kind of off topic, but did you ever have a time like that?\""
    
    "She really is asking about random things."
    
    "She's looking at the playing children, so she's probably asking about that."
    
    "\".... Hmm, Maybe."
    
    "I played around a lot as a kid, but that was only inside the mansion."
    
    "I rarely ever played in a park like this.\""
    
    ".... That's right."
    
    "My only playmates were Akiha and the others."
    
    "I never played with people I didn't know like these kids."
    
    "I might have been more like.."
    
    "A kid who led an insulated life."
    
    "\"What about you, Arcueid?"
    
    ".... Um, you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.\""
    
    ".... Um, if vampires didn't have a childhood, asking her would be rude."

    "\"Yeah."
    
    "Like you're thinking, I never had a childhood."
    
    "While I was weak as an individual, I slept through it, and I was active only when my existence was at its peak."
    
    "That's why I thought it was strange."
    
    "Infancy and old age are such useless times, why do people manage to live through it?\""
    
    "She seems to be almost asking herself, not me."
    
    "\".... Arcueid?\""
    
    "\"It's nothing."
    
    "This is the first time I ever spent time doing nothing, so my thoughts seem to be malfunctioning.\""
    
    scene expression 'background/BG_29A.jpg' at bgpos
    
    "Saying that, Arcueid stands up from the bench."
    
    "I stand up with her."
    
    ".... Well, we've already been in the sun for about two hours, so we should probably head into the city."
    
    "\"----Oh, if it was dull you should've told me so.\""

    "\"Hm, maybe it is dull, but it wasn't boring."
    
    "I was even thinking I'd like to spend more time if it's this kind of dull, but you didn't like it?\""
    
    "\"Eh....?\""
    
    ".... That's right, even if it was uneventful, it wasn't boring."
    
    "Come to think of it, spending time sunbathing with Arcueid is something pretty rare."
    
    "\"----That's right, it wasn't bad at all."
    
    "But, let's get something to eat."
    
    "I haven't had anything since this morning, so I'm pretty hungry.\""
    
    "Saying that, we start to walk from the park."
    
    "\"Hm------\""
    
    "For a brief moment, I think about holding her hand but I stop right away."
    
    "There wasn't any reason for it before, so it felt natural to do so."
    
    "But now that I have a reason to do so, to hold her hand seems very senseless."
    
    ".... To be senseless means that taking notice is the result of less-than-pure thoughts."
    
    "\"I'm full of theories today.\""
    
    "Geez."
    
    "Just like Arcueid says, I guess I do a lot of useless things."
