    ".... Is the window open?"
    
    "I can hear the soft singing of birds from the garden."
    
    "A cool breeze blows across my face."
    
    "I feel the sunlight hitting my eyelids."
    
    "A quiet, gentle atmosphere."
    
    "A gentle morning."
    
    "Morning?"
    
    "I guess I fell asleep last night as Akiha cared for me, and slept till now."
    
    "Lying down, my body feels heavy."
    
    "But I feel much better than I did yesterday."
    
    "I decide to open my eyes and sit up."
    
    "And----"

    "\"Ah."
    
    "The little rascal finally woke up.\""
    
    ".... I see Arcueid's face right in front of mine."
    
    "\"......!?\""
    
    "My brain goes blank and stops working due to this unexpected event."
    
    "My mouth opens and closes, but my voice seems to be missing."
    
    "---Seriously, what's going on?"
    
    "Arcueid is in front of me."
    
    "This is my room."
    
    "It's past nine o'clock in the morning,"
    
    "She's come inside, still wearing her shoes; that's all I know for now."
    
    "\"Y-Y-Y-You!\""
    
    "\"Liar."
    
    "We promised to meet again yesterday.\""
    
    "She must be in a pretty bad mood as her red eyes have lost their usual beauty."
    
    "---No, not lost at all."
    
    "Being this close, her beauty is more vivid than usual."
    
    "Arcueid glares at me as I lay in bed."
    
    "\".... W-Wait, Arcueid."
    
    "W-Why are you in my room this morning....!?\""
    
    "I start to shout, but I stop myself."
    
    "If I shouted now, Hisui would come here and it would all be over."
    
    "---Everything is still chaotic, but my brain can grasp that much."
    
    "\"A-Anyway, move....!"
    
    "Just going into someone's room, threatening a sleeping person, don't you know how awful that is....!?\""
    
    "\"What's with that attitude?"
    
    "I came here because you broke your promise."
    
    "Sleeping while making someone wait, just what in the world were you planning?\""
    
    "She stares at me ill-temperedly."
    
    ".... I calm down."
    
    "That's right."
    
    "I really did break my promise to meet Arcueid last night."
    
    "\".... Mmmm.\""
    
    "I finally understand the situation."
    
    "I understand why Arcueid's angry."
    
    "I understand, but to do this.. to come into someone's room still wearing shoes like that, what does she intend to do?"
    
    "Seeing that the window is open, she probably came in through there."
    
    "\".... I see, since I broke my promise, I'm at fault here."
    
    "But sneaking in here is going a little far, you know.\""
    
    "\"This isn't your house, Shiki.\""
    
    "She gives a quick retort."
    
    "\"You know, I really was angry before."
    
    "I waited for many hours, and as soon as I realized you weren't coming, I got so incredibly angry."
    
    "I was thinking I would never let this happen again and I'd rip your throat out.\""
    
    "She speaks, still looking ill-tempered."
    
    "\"Do you get it, Shiki?"
    
    "That feeling, I couldn't resist it."
    
    "Even though I know I should calm down, the more I thought about it, the angrier I got.\""
    
    "As if she still felt that way, her red eyes seem to blame me."
    
    "\"Yeah.. I guess you can't help yourself.\""
    
    "Giving thanks to God my neck is still attached, I keep the conversation going."
    
    "\"Isn't it?"
    
    "And I snuck in here, but since you were sleeping I decided to wait."
    
    "At least I wanted to hear your excuse."
    
    "And, since I didn't have anything to do, I watched your sleeping face."
    
    ".... Yeah, your sleeping face was very quiet, it was almost scary."
    
    "Sleeping like you were dead, I started feeling uneasy because I thought that maybe you would never wake up.\""
    
    "I sigh."
    
    "\"If you were uneasy then you should've woke me."
    
    "I'm uneasy when you're next to me.\""
    
    "\"But, I thought it would be a waste."
    
    ".... I don't know what I look like when I sleep, but I thought it would be real good if I slept like you did."
    
    "I wondered why you look so peaceful while I watched you sleep."
    
    "While I was doing that, my anger disappeared, and then you woke up.\""
    
    "\".... Then you've been here this whole time?"
    
    "From last night until now?\""
    
    "\"Yeah."
    
    "People from this house came in a few times, but I hid myself so it was okay."
    
    "A girl also came to wake you up, but I didn't like her so I sent her away.\""
    
    "Arcueid laughs brightly."
    
    "\"Wait, you sent her away?"
    
    "How?\""
    
    "\"I wasn't rough."
    
    "Didn't I tell you before that vampires have Mystic Eyes of Enchantment?"
    
    "I merely used suggestion on her, saying that 'Shiki has already gone to school' and didn't leave any memory of her meeting me.\""
    
    "\"No memory?"
    
    "You....\""
    
    "Really are a troublesome person."
    
    ".... Well, even if she is troublesome, at least she took care not to be detected."
    
    "I bring my hands to my head as I sigh."
    
    "\"Alright."
    
    "Sorry for yesterday, Arcueid."
    
    "I don't know if this is making up for it, but I won't break any more promises."
    
    "Yeah, I promise.\""
    
    "I look her right in the eye as I declare this."
    
    "\"Are you sure?\""
    
    "\"I'm sure."
    
    "Because I now realize your revenge is scary....\""
    
    "Still lying down, I raise my hands in surrender."
    
    "All of a sudden, her bad mood disappears completely."
    
    "Arcueid gives a satisfied nod and says 'alright'."
