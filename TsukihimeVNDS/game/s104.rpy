    "I slice his outstretched arm."
    
    "Hundreds of \"points of death\" are on his body."
    
    "But, more than that,"
    
    "deep inside of him, in his very center, I can see his \"Ultimate Point\"."
    
    "----It doesn't matter how many lives he has."
    
    "I am only going to kill the \"existence\" of Nrvnqsr Chaos."
    
    "So, it isn't killing Nrvnqsr,"
    
    "but the chaos which is him."
    
    "I am going to kill one world-------"
    
    "I attack him head-on."
    
    "A light sound of impact."
    
    "----The knife pierces into his center."
    
    "Twisting his lips in a grin, the vampire laughs voicelessly."
    
    "\"This can't be.\""
    
    "Numbly,"
    
    "The Black Beast starts to crumble from his fingertips."
    
    "\"------You.. are my death?\""
    
    "His body temperature rapidly dwindles."
    
    "The end is instantaneous like a dropping curtain."
    
    "With this one attack,"
    
    "along with the remaining 560 beasts, Nrvnqsr Chaos is annihilated."
