    "It seemed like it wasn't pain from her wound, but---"
    
    "\"Hm?\""
    
    "What is that?"
    
    "It feels like there's someone lurking in the shadows not illuminated by the streetlights."

    "No, that's not it."
    
    "All my arms are doing,"

    "That's all I can see, so I swing my knife through the dark air after those lines."
    
    "As a result, the bandaged man's knife is simply stopping mine."

    "Clang!"
    
    "Despite not being able to see his knife due to its speed, I somehow manage to block it over and over."
    
    "The reason I can defend myself is simple."
    
    "Because, where he's aiming are the \"lines\" on my body."
    
    "So I know where he is aiming at and I understand more than anyone that having them cut would mean instant death, so I have to defend it."
    
    "No, wait."

    "Yes."
