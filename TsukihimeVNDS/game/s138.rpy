    "----The night has just begun."
    
    "No, to be more exact, if Arcueid would be walking around, it would most likely be during the night rather than during the day."
    
    "\".... I guess it would be more efficient to search around town.\""
    
    ".... I don't want to think about it, but most of the victims are usually found in alleys."
    
    "If I want to find Arcueid----if I want to find the vampire killer who's continuing to murder, then I have to stick to searching the streets."
    
    "\"----Damn it."
    
    "What am I doing!?\""
    
    "Not understanding my own feelings, I curse and start to run around aimlessly."

    "I sit down on the guard rail."
    
    "It's been several hours already."
    
    "I looked around aimlessly, and I didn't even catch a single glimpse of Arcueid."
    
    "\"........ Damn it.\""
    
    "It's so, frustrating."
    
    "Of course, I knew it isn't easy to just randomly find someone in town, but I still felt optimistic I would find her."
    
    "\"Where did she go....?\""
    
    ".... Why?"
    
    "I just wanted to ask her about the serial killings, but once I find out I can't see her, I----"
    
    "\"Ah, stop."
    
    "Stop."
    
    "I should just stop.\""
    
    "I stand up from the guardrail and start walking."
    
    "It'll be midnight soon."
    
    "Searching for Arcueid any longer really is just useless."
    
    "\"........\""
    
    "But, if I've gone this far, I can do just a little more."
    
    "There's one last place I need to check."
    
    "If she's not there, then I'll go back to the mansion."

    "\".... That's right."
    
    "It's not like I can conveniently find her.\""
    
    "I breath out a sigh and slump my shoulders."
    
    "\".... How stupid."
    
    "Why am I so disappointed?\""
    
    "I don't understand it myself."
    
    "Just, once more----I think maybe I wanted to see her smile."

    "\".... Well, I guess it works out."
    
    "To be honest, I wanted to see you too."
    
    "So meeting here, um----\""
    
    "I was about to say it makes me really happy, but I frantically choke those words off."
    
    "\"----Anyway, I want to have a serious talk."
    
    "I want to talk about it somewhere else since I feel uneasy here, so is that okay?\""
    
    "\"Sure----but talk about what?\""

    ".... Let's go more to the back of the park.\""
