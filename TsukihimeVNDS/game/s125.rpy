    "Try to be calm, it can't hurt."
    
    "----First, this is my room."

    "My hands gripping the sheets are drenched in sweat."
    
    "There is a lingering warmth as if I really was sleeping with Arcueid until just now."
    
    ".... But it definitely was a dream."
    
    "I can't tell if that's something I should be happy or disappointed about."
    
    "\"----Why----\""
    
    "did I see such a dream?"
    
    "Does that mean I'm so interested in her that I see her in my dreams?"
    
    "Does that mean--I want her so bad I do those things with her in my dream?"
    
    "\"------Uu\""
    
    "As I remember, the sensation of her skin forces itself into my brain."
    
    "I feel my arms to make sure this is real."
    
    ".... Yeah, it's real."
    
    "Her skin was so fundamentally different from a guy's skin.. so soft, so warm."
    
    "\"Yeah.... So hot I wanted to go wild.\""
    
    "Just thinking about it makes my breath go wild."
    
    ".... Well."
    
    "Whatever happened, it's true that it felt exceedingly good."
    
    "I should feel a bit guilty dreaming about doing that to Arcueid, but I recall the dream and just sit there thinking about it."
