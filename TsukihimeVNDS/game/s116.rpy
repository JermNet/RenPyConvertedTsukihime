    "\"....?"
    
    "I wonder what Hisui is doing?\""
    
    "Tilting my head to the side, I head for the front gate."

    "\"Um---were you waiting for me to come home?\""
    
    "\"Yes."
    
    "Greeting the master is a servant's duty.\""
    
    "Answering very matter-of-factly, she doesn't even bat an eyelash."
    
    "\"Um, Hisui, I'm truly happy you waited to greet me, but there's really no need to wait outside."
    
    "I'll come back on my own, so you can just greet me whenever you realize I'm back.\""

    "........ *sigh*"

    "Well, there's quite a mountain of studying, reviewing, and memorizing a student like me has to do."
    
    "But, I just don't feel like doing anything."
    
    "Suddenly, Arcueid's face flashes in my mind."
    
    "Whether good or bad, it's probably just a reaction to the crazy two days I just had."
    
    "Perhaps spacing out here in my room will be good, giving my mind and heart a break."
