    "----I'll search the shopping district."
    
    "Even though she was in so much pain, she's not the kind of person to rest because of it."
    
    "She told me to go back."
    
    "In other words, she was saying she won't be going back."
    
    "I think she plans on finding the vampire by herself."
    
    "Then----I'll go to the shopping district and find the vampire or The Dead before she does."
    
    "Arcueid can't find them, but I can spot The Dead if I take off my glasses."
    
    "\"------Alright.\""
    
    "Taking off my glasses and grimacing from the slight headache, I run to the shopping district."

    "\"Ugh----\""
    
    "The pain races through my forehead."
    
    ".... I'm not particularly concentrating on looking for \"lines\", but it seems running through town without my glasses on is a huge burden on my brain."
    
    "\"Damn it----still, I'm not finding anything.\""
    
    ".... All the people walking through the shopping district have normal \"lines\" on them."
    
    "I don't see anyone painted with the disjointed scribbles I saw before."
    
    "\".... Ow\""
    
    "I rub my temples with my fingers."
    
    "As long as I have my glasses off, this headache will only get worse."
    
    "But still--I can't give up this easily."
    
    "Taking a deep breath, I start to run through the shopping district once more."

    "I start to pant from exertion."
    
    "The exhaustion from running coupled with the pain in my head makes me nauseous."
    
    "No matter how many times I run around, I can't find any Dead or anything out of the ordinary."
    
    "Lifting up my hand to my forehead, I feel a feverish heat."
    
    "It really does feel like I have a high fever."
    
    "\".... Damn it, I'm not done yet----\""
    
    "I tell myself this as I start to run once more."
    
    "----And then."
