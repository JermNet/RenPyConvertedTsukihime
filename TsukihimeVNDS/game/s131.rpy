    "\".... As usual, I don't understand her at all."
    
    "What the heck is she doing?\""
    
    "I sit down in my chair and watch her."
    
    "Senpai crosses her arms as if thinking about something, and stares at the students passing by."
    
    "\"Maybe she dropped something.\""
    
    ".... It sounds weird for a third-year student to drop something in the second-year hallway, but this is the ever-roaming Senpai we're talking about."
    
    "----Huh?"
    
    "Senpai suddenly enters into my classroom."
    
    "She strides directly to me."
